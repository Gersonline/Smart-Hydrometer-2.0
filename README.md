# Smart Hidrometer

This repository presents an academic new version of a low-cost project that aims to assist a human task using the Internet of Things (IoT) for sustainable development. It is a smart digital water meter that calculates water consumption using an ESP board, also known as an Arduino with the 8266 chipset, in order to inform the user of water consumption in liters and the cost in Brazilian reais based on the real-time tariffs of the water utility. The consumption measurements, along with the tariff calculations, are presented to the user through a global website developed in Python using the Django framework, where queries can be made for each specific water meter, a local website connected to the user's internal network, and a 1.3-inch OLED display. This communication between the water meter and the user aims to provide better control over water consumption in homes and businesses, with the expectation of resulting in positive financial and environmental impacts.
